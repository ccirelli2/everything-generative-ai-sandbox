Notes
=================================
- Created in 2019.
- Purpose to store massive embedding vectors generated by deep NN.
- Designed to deal with vectors created from unstructured data.
- Milvus is able to analyze the correlation between two vectors by calculating
their similarity distance.
- Unstructured data: images, speech, text, video, 80% of worlds data.
- Vector Similarity Search
    - Process of comparing a vector to a database of vectors to find those that
    are most similar.
    - Approximate nearest neighbor approach is used.
- Uses
    - Image, text, voice, video similarity search.
    - Recommender System - recommend information or products based on user
      behaviors and needs.
        - How could this applly to underwriter?  Cross sell products.
        - Possibles risks (kind of like imputation).
        - Possible exclusions.
