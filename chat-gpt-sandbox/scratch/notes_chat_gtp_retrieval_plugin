Retrieval Plugin
======================

- Plugin
    - This is a plugin for ChatGPT that enables semantic search and retrieval of personal
    or organizational documents.  it allows users to obtain the most relevant document
    snippets from their data sources, such as files, notes, or emails by asking questions
    or expressing needs in natural language.
    - The plugin uses OpenAIs text-embedding-data-002 embeddings model to generate embeddings
    of document chunks and then stores and queries them using a vector database on the backend.
    - Several vector database providers are supported.
    - FastAPI server exposes the plugin's endpoints for upserting, querying and deleting
    documents.
- Metadata Files
    - Users can refine their search results by providing metadata filters by source, author,
    or other criteria.
    - ?? The vector database needs to be hosted on a server??
- Memory Feature
    - retrieval plugin can provide ChatGPT with memory.  By utilizing the plugins
    upsert endpoint, ChatGPT can save snippets from the conversation to the vector database
    for later reference.
    - **this functionality contributes to a more context-aware chat experience by allowing
    ChatGPT to remember and retrieve information from previous conversations.
- Security
    - The retrieval system is using context learning.
    - It allows ChatGPT to source important information from the vector database, add it to
    the conversation (context) to then be utilized in the current session.
    - This information does not go back to source.
- Fast API
    - Retrieval plugin is built using FastAPI, a web framework for building APIs with Python.
    - API exposes the following endpoints - upser, query, deleting documents from the vector
    database.


Notes
======================
- It may be the case that we need first research the dependencies associated with this project.
- It is likely the case that we need to know how to use vector databases and possibly
have a subscription.
- Docs:
    - includes documentation for setting up and using each vector database provider,
    webhook, and removing unused dependencies.
