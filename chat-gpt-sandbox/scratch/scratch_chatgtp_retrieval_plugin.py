or organizational documents.  it allows users to obtain the most relevant document
snippets from their data sources, such as files, notes, or emails by asking questions
or expressing needs in natural language.

Notes
======================
- It may be the case that we need first research the dependencies associated with this project.

have a subscription.

    - includes documentation for setting up and using each vector database provider,
    webhook, and removing unused dependencies.
